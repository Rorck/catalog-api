# Prometheus-X Catalog API

The Prometheus-X Catalog API is a catalog management API that allows ecosystem administrators to manage their ecosystems, data/service providers to register their data & services, and enables users to browse the catalog. This API provides a platform for organizing and discovering various offerings within the Prometheus-X ecosystem.

## Prometheus-X Service Ecosystem

The Catalog API is one of the components allowing management of the catalog. Even though it is independant and serves its own purpose, users of a catalog will need interaction with more than one service. Thus, if you want to run a full catalog, consider looking into deploying the [Catalog Registry](https://github.com/Prometheus-X-association/catalog-registry) and the [Ecosystem Matcher](https://github.com/Prometheus-X-association/ecosystem-matcher), two components expanding on the catalog API to offer a more complete set of features.

In addition, the Prometheus-X Full specifications can be found on the [Prometheus-X docs repo/wiki](https://github.com/Prometheus-X-association/docs/wiki/Prometheus%E2%80%90X-Building-Blocks:-Enabling-Secure-Data-Ecosystems-and-Consent%E2%80%90driven-Data-Sharing)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prometheus-X-association/catalog-api.git
cd prometheus-x-catalog-api
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Copy .env.sample to .env and setup your environment variables
```bash
cp .env.sample .env
# Setup your variables in .env
```

### Docker
1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/Prometheus-X-association/catalog-api.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd catalog-api` and copy the .env.sample to .env `cp .env.sample .env`
3. Configure the application by setting up the necessary environment variables. You will need to specify database connection details and other relevant settings.
4. Create a docker network using `docker network create ptx`
5. Start the application: `docker-compose up -d`
6. If you need to rebuild the image `docker-compose build` and restart with: `docker-compose up -d`
7. If you don't want to use the mongodb container from the docker compose you can use the command `docker run -d -p your-port:your-port --name catalog-api catalog-api` after running `docker-compose build`

## Terraform

1. Install Terraform: Ensure Terraform is installed on your machine.
2. Configure Kubernetes: Ensure you have access to your Kubernetes cluster and kubectl is configured.
3. Initialize Terraform: Run the following commands from the terraform directory.
```sh
cd terraform
terraform init
```
4. Apply the Configuration: Apply the Terraform configuration to create the resources.
```sh
terraform apply
```
5. Retrieve Service IP: After applying the configuration, retrieve the service IP.
```sh
terraform output catalog_api_service_ip
```

> * Replace placeholder values in the `kubernetes_secret` resource with actual values from your `.env`.
> * Ensure the `server_port` value matches the port used in your application.
> * Adjust the `host_path` in the `kubernetes_persistent_volume` resource to an appropriate path on your Kubernetes nodes.

### Deployment with Helm

1. **Install Helm**: Ensure Helm is installed on your machine. You can install it following the instructions [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

2. **Package the Helm chart**:
    ```sh
    helm package ./path/to/catalog-api
    ```

3. **Deploy the Helm chart**:
    ```sh
    helm install catalog-api ./path/to/catalog-api
    ```

4. **Verify the deployment**:
    ```sh
    kubectl get all -n catalog-api
    ```

5. **Retrieve Service IP**:
    ```sh
    kubectl get svc -n catalog-api
    ```

> * Replace placeholder values in the `values.yaml` file with actual values from your `.env`.
> * Ensure the `port` value matches the port used in your application.
> * Configure your MongoDB connection details in the values.yaml file to point to your managed MongoDB instance.

### Running the API

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```


By default, the API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Documentation

### Authentication

The Prometheus-X Catalog API currently uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. To access certain endpoints, you need to include a valid JWT bearer token in the request header.

Authentication via a decentralized wallet is planned.

### Endpoints

For a complete list of all available endpoints, along with their request and response schemas, refer to the [JSON Swagger Specification](./docs/swagger.json) provided or visit the [github-pages](https://prometheus-x-association.github.io/catalog-api/) of this repository which displays the swagger specification with the Swagger UI.
